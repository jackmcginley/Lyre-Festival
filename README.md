# Lyre-Festival
Music festival website created as first bootcamp project

(You can tell it's an assigned project because half the headlline acts at the festival are no longer alive!!)

This uses only HTML and CSS, no javascript.  It has multiple pages and uses variety of display styles including CSS grid.

The site was created to have responsive design so it continues to work effectively on smaller screens.

It includes an active HTML form, an iframe running video, and live Google maps.
